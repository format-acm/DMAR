Main prompt:
“Create a very simple Streamlit app in Python that connects to my PostgreSQL database pagila_dwh and reads from the view vw_rental_analysis.
Show two reports on the same page: 1. a bar chart of rentals or revenue by film_category,
and 2. a line chart of monthly rental trends (rentals or revenue) using year and month.
Use psycopg2 and Plotly, keep the code clean and easy to understand.”

What worked well:
- Connecting to PostgreSQL with psycopg2 and validating the connection with a quick COUNT(*)
- Using simple SQL GROUP BY queries to aggregate data for both charts
- Plotly + Streamlit made it easy to display the charts and data tables

Good to know:
- Streamlit apps must be started with streamlit run main.py in terminal
- Exact database login needed using the correct existing PostgreSQL user and password
